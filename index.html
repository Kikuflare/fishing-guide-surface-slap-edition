          This post prompted fellow FFXIV fisher Tyo'to Tayuun to share some
          data which directly contradicts the conclusion of this post. You can

          The evidence he has provided is much stronger than what I have shared
          in this post. For the sake of transparency I will leave this post up,
          but I would highly suggest disregarding what I wrote here in favour of
          the stronger evidence. Either way, I'm happy to be proven wrong and to
          finally get some answers about this subject.

          Hi, I'm Kiku. In 2019 (late Stormblood) I wrote a
          <a
            href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/11519702/blog/4290487/"

          on the Lodestone explaining various fishing mechanics in FFXIV. At
          that time, there were not many resources related to fishing readily
          available to the public, and my goal was to make knowledge of fishing
          mechanics more easily accesible for players interested in fishing.
          When Shadowbringers came out, I gradually updated the guide with
          information about the newly added skills at that time, up until 2021.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          I'm writing this post in 2024 and the availability of quality fishing
          resources is much better, which is partly why I haven't updated my
          guide for changes released in Endwalker. However, one thing I'd like
          to address in this post and for which I caught a lot of flak for when
          I first wrote it in 2021 was this line from Part 2 of my fishing
          guide:
        </p>

                Surface Slap won't directly increase your chances of landing a
                bite of a big fish, but it can be used to indirectly gain more
                casts in a window if you use it to filter out a fish with a long
                bite time.

          Some people weren't happy with me for claiming (without evidence,
          admittedly) that Surface Slap does not influence bite rates for big
          fish. The popular sentiment I see in fishing discussions is that, when
          targeting a big fish, it is advantageous to use Surface Slap because
          it would raise the bite rate of the big fish by removing the slapped
          fish from the pool. On the surface, this seems like a reasonable
          interpretation of the skill's tooltip. However, the reason I have
          never removed the above quote from my fishing guide is because,
          contrary to the prevailing opinion, I personally do not believe that
          Surface Slap increases the bite rate of big fish apart from a singular
          edge case (The Unconditional). To clarify, I believe that the
          developers intentionally programmed Surface Slap to not have an effect
          on modifying big fish bite rates unless a big fish is the only
          remaining option in the pool after using Surface Slap.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          It's think it's fair to criticize me for making unsubstantiated
          claims, but in the 5 years since I wrote that line
          <strong>
            I have not seen a single person provide any sort of hard evidence or
            data to disprove what I originally claimed.
          </strong>
          Sure, to some degree the burden is on me to provide proof of my
          claims, but I don't think it is unreasonable to verify what is
          popularly believed to be true.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Today, I am writing this post to share that I have finally conducted
          my own tests on Surface Slap and I will be documenting the results of
          these tests below. Truthfully, I have been wanting to conduct a study
          on Surface Slap since the end of Shadowbringers, but I have had
          neither the time nor the motivation to finish this project until now
          (only a few days before Dawntrail releases, I might add).

        <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Testing methodology</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">
          I conducted a study on big fish bite rates by examining bite rates at
          a single fishing hole under the following conditions.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The big fish must be a straight catch and have 100% uptime to make
            it easier to collect the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bites while Surface Slap is active will not be hooked so that
            Surface Slap need not be constantly reapplied.
          </li>
          <li>
            The big fish must be the only !!! bite in the pool to be able to
            identify it without catching it and breaking Surface Slap.
          </li>
          <li>
            A minimum of 1000 casts with and without Surface Slap active to
            provide a decent sample size.
          </li>
          <li>
            A fish will be picked after determining the ratio of each fish in
            the pool, and Surface Slap will be used on this and only this fish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chum and Hi-Cordials will be used to speed up data collection.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="fs-5">
          These conditions allow me to estimate the baseline bite rate of each
          fish in the fishing hole without Surface Slap. After establishing the
          baseline, I will check the bite rates while Surface Slap is active and
          see if the bite rate of the big fish is significantly impacted by
          Surface Slap using statistical analysis methods.
        </p>

          for this study. Apart from fulfilling the first condition above, there
          isn't anything special about this fishing hole other than the fact
          that my player estate is located at Shirogane and it is convenient for
          me to access it.

          Some bites went uncaught either to due the fish escaping, or me
          failing to press hook. These failed casts are included in the dataset
          to more accurately represent the bite ratios. The reason I did over
          1000 casts was because I selected a fish to Surface Slap only after
          reaching 1000 casts, and it was necessary to catch it a few times to
          reapply Surface Slap due to hitting amiss.

          Glass Tuna was selected as the fish to Surface Slap. Supposing that
          Surface Slap
          <em>does</em>
          have an effect on big fish bite rate and that the effect is
          proportional to the Surface Slap target's ratio, I chose the fish
          which had the highest proportion in the fishing hole. Looking at the
          data, I suspect that Striped Fugu has an equal bite rate to that of
          Glass Tuna, but it is not terribly important which fish is chosen as
          the Surface Slap target as long as it is consistent for all 1000
          casts.

        <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Analysis of results</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">
          As you can see, a 0.38% difference in the legendary bite ratio is not
          terribly high, which already suggests that Surface Slap made little to
          no difference. However, we can use statistics to make a stronger
          statement.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          I apologize in advance for any mathematical errors in this section, as
          it has been quite a while since I've touched upon statistics in my
          personal life. Regardless, it is beyond the scope of this post to
          explain the reasoning behind the formulae used; please verify on your
          own if you do not trust my calculations. I will do my best to try to
          briefly explain some concepts for those without any knowledge of
          statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Simply put, we want to determine whether or not the two samples differ
          significantly based on whether or not Surface Slap is used. We will
          start with what is called a "null hypothesis" and see if the data is
          strong enough to reject it. The null hypothesis for this analysis is:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>
              <strong>
                Surface Slap does not affect the bite rates of big fish.
              </strong>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </figure>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Using the numbers from the dataset, we can calculate something called
          a z-score; if the value of the z-score is between a certain range,
          then we cannot reject the null hypothesis. We will set a 95%
          confidence level for our test, so the range will be from -1.96 to
          1.96. The formula used for calculating the z-score is as follows:

          Which gives us a z-score of -0.3765. Because our z-score falls between

        <p class="fs-5">
          The analysis suggests that no significant difference in bite rate for
          the big fish was observed between the two populations when Surface
          Slap was used. This does not necessarily mean that the the null
          hypothesis is true, only that the evidence did not prove the null
          hypothesis to be false. At the very least,

            >the test did not demonstrate any connection between Surface Slap
            and big fish bite rates</strong

        <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5" />
        <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Let's be clear about something: This post is not about attacking
          anyone who believes that Surface Slap works the way the tooltip
          advertises. I put together this post out of my own personal interest
          in the subject and to finally have some data to back up my original
          claim.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          I am also not saying that you should never use Surface Slap when
          hunting a big fish. If you re-read the original quote from the guide,
          I suggest a strategy of using Surface Slap to potentially increase the
          number of attempts during a limited window. If there's anything to
          take away from this post, it's that there's no sense in just using
          Surface Slap on any random target for the sake of "thinning out the
          pool".
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5">
          I'm sure there will be some who will read this post and disagree with
          the evidence and my conclusions. I encourage everyone to perform their
          own trials and try to replicate the results shown here, especially in
          other fishing holes. I highly doubt it, but there could be a chance
          that the developers made Shirogane a special fishing hole that
          interacts with Surface Slap differently. I'm joking, but it's always
          good to have more data.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5">
          A counterargument from the armchair developers that I don't want to
          hear is something along the lines of "it would be harder to code
          Surface Slap to work a certain way". First of all, none of us here has
          or ever will lay eyes on the backend code, so the presumed difficulty
          of such an implementation is entirely speculative. Secondly, anyone
          who has spent any meaningful amount of time in professional
          development would know that if the business logic dictates that
          something must behave a certain way, whether it would be more
          difficult to implement it that way is largely irrelevant unless there
          is some kind of unsurmountable technical challenge. Lastly, my
          personal assessment is that it would not be terribly difficult to
          implement some kind of check in the code to maintain a target bite
          rate for Surface Slap; the solution would likely not be trivial, but I
          do think it is rather embarrassing for any competent developer to
          claim that such a check would be too difficult to code.

          Preemptively addressing some questions
        </h2>
        <div class="fs-5">
          <h3>How was the data collected?</h3>
          <p class="fs-5">
            I recorded and exported my fishing records using the GatherBuddy
            add-on. I then wrote a script to interpret the data, available
            <a href="./stats.js">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Why is there a time gap in the data?</h3>
          <p class="fs-5">
            The data is a bit intermittent at the start because I collected it
            during the patch that Endwalker legendaries released and I
            prioritized completing my fishing log over collecting the data.
            There is another gap of several months where I was busy with other
            things in my personal life that prevented me from finding the time
            to properly sit down to fish.
          </p>
          <h3>Why didn't you pick some other fishing hole?</h3>
          <p class="fs-5">
            I suppose I could have optimized for a fishing hole with shorter
            average bite times or cheaper bait, but I didn't think it was useful
            to spend time trying to determine what the "best" fishing hole would
            be.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Why did you believe that Surface Slap does not affect big fish bite
            rates in the first place?
          </h3>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Let's call it my intuition as someone who has been fishing in this
            game for several years. It feels naive that it would help the player
            in that way, is what I'm saying. This is pure speculation on my
            part, but I get the sense that whoever is designing fishing content
            for FFXIV is not someone who would allow their carefully selected
            bite rates to be affected by Surface Slap. My understanding of the
            research I've seen by a moderator on the Fisherman's Horizon Discord
            server about whether fish added by Studium/Facet quests affect big
            fish bite rates seems to corroborate my theory.

            Feel free to stop reading here, this part is unrelated to the main
            topic of this post.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5">
            For those still reading, I'd like to express my gratitude for
            reading this far. I'd also like to use this part to say a few
            things. Firstly, I apologize for the changing the URL of my weather
            forecasting tool earlier this year. GitHub doesn't show me how often
            the tool gets visited (and I have no interest in adding a tracker),
            but it seems that quite a few people other than myself have been
            using the tool, and there was some confusion when the URL suddenly
            stopped working due to my username change. Perhaps the issue could
            have been mitigated if I had informed someone about the URL change
            but I don't actually interact with anyone else in the fishing
            community.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5">
            As for future plans, I will continue to update my weather
            forecasting tool (feature suggestions are welcomed by the way) but
            otherwise, this post will probably be my last contribution to the
            fishing community. While accessible to all FFXIV players, The
            Lodestone is not exactly a great place to be making content on for
            English speakers due to the 10000 character limit per post. I've had
            to make compromises in regards to the quality of my fishing guide to
            keep it within the limits of two posts, which has made updating them
            difficult. Nevertheless, I hope my contributions have been helpful
            in some way to the fishing community over the years and moving
            forward, I wish everyone the best of luck in completing their
            fishing goals.
